A short python script made to batch hide / unhide directories. Functions in the current working directory
No pre-requisite required

To use:
The program will launch and create hidefile.txt to which you put the directories in lines 2 and below.
Please note that the directories have to be enclosed in quotation marks but Windows does that automatically when you right click and select "Copy as Path"
